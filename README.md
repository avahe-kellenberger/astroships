# Gameplay

Astroships is an online battle area arcade-style game. Players destroy asteroids to collect resources in order to level up, and obtain power-ups (such as missiles, huge speed boosts, and shields).

Leveling up increases your max health, and the size of your ship. The player with the highest level is listed on the leaderboard - it is your goal to reach the highest level, and destroy all others in your path.

If you are blown up, you lose all progress and must start over from the beginning.
